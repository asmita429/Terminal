Paths: absolute & relative Path

cd Desktop/Delta (relative path) = relative to our current location
eg: cd Desktop/apna

cd/Users/Dell/Desktop (absolute path) = it doesn't depend on current working directory
eg: cd/Desktop/Apna/terminal

/ = root directory
eg: cd / 
$ pwd
/

~ = home directory
eg: cd ~
$ pwd
/c/Users/Dell


Making directories

mkdir = make directory (folders)
eg: mkdir delta/newDir2/hello2  creates hello2

Flags: 
flags are characters that we pass with commands to modify their behaviour
manual command
man ls: give info about ls command
man mkdir: give info about mkdir command

with Flags (additional information)
ls -l //additional info about folders/files
ls -a //lists directories whose name begins with a "."
ls -la //list hidden files + additional info

Touch Command 

change file access and modification times. If any does not exist,
it is created with default permissions.
eg:
touch index.html
touch app.js
touch style.css
=>
ls
app.js  index.html  style.css


Deleting files & folder (warning)

//deleted file/folder is impossible if we use terminal

rm -removes files
rmdir -removes empty folder
rm-rf -removes any folder(remove recursively).

eg:
rm app.js index.html style.css
delete all 3 files

rmdir hello
